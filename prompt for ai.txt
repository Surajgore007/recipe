You are helping me build a hackathon project. Follow these rules strictly:
Tech: Single HTML file only. Vanilla JS + Gemini API (gemini-1.5-flash) for text/analysis/vision tasks. For image generation use Pollinations API (https://image.pollinations.ai/prompt/{text}) — no key needed, just an img tag. No frameworks, no npm, no backend, no build steps.
UI: Extremely minimal. Just what's needed to make it work — input field, button, output area. No animations, no fancy colors, no extra sections. Functional over beautiful.
Code rules:

Hardcode the Gemini API key as a variable at the top so I can swap it easily
All logic in one <script> tag inside the HTML file
Call Gemini API directly via fetch() — no SDK
Handle loading state (disable button + show "Generating...") and basic errors

Deployment: The file will be pushed to GitHub and deployed on Vercel as-is. So it must work as a standalone HTML file with zero config.
Output: Give me ONLY the complete HTML file. No explanation, no instructions, no markdown around it. Just the raw code.
Now here is the problem I need to solve:
